# STL File Reader and Data Exporter

## Overview
This C++ program is designed to read an STL (Stereolithography) file and export its data to a text file. STL files are commonly used for representing 3D surface geometry and are widely used in 3D printing and computer-aided design (CAD) applications.

## Features
- Read an STL file.
- Extract data such as vertices, normals, and triangles from the STL file.
- Write the extracted data to a text file for further analysis or processing.

## Getting Started
To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as `g++`.
3. Compile the source code files using the compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ -o stl_reader stl_reader.cpp

## Output
After running the program, a text file named stl_data.txt will be generated in the same directory as the executable. This file contains the extracted data from the input STL file, organized for easy analysis.

Visualizing Data with Gnuplot
You can use Gnuplot, a versatile plotting utility, to visualize the data stored in the generated text file. Gnuplot provides powerful features for creating 2D and 3D plots from data files.

## To visualize the data using Gnuplot, follow these steps:

Install Gnuplot on your system if you haven't already. You can download it from the official Gnuplot website.
Use Gnuplot to create plots based on the data in the stl_data.txt file. For example, you can create a 3D plot of the vertices or visualize the surface normals.
## Dependencies
This program does not require any external libraries or dependencies beyond the standard C++ libraries.
