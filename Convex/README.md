Convex Hull Gift Wrapping Algorithm for 2D (C++)


This repository contains an implementation of the Convex Hull Gift Wrapping Algorithm for 2D in C++. The Convex Hull problem is a fundamental problem in computational geometry, and the Gift Wrapping Algorithm, also known as Jarvis March, is one of the simple algorithms to solve it efficiently.
Overview

The Convex Hull of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points in the set. The Gift Wrapping Algorithm iteratively selects the points on the hull by choosing the point with the smallest polar angle from the current point.
Implementation

The ConvexHull.cpp file contains the implementation of the Gift Wrapping Algorithm. It defines a function convexHull that takes a vector of 2D points as input and returns the convex hull of those points.
