# Geometric Console Application

The objective of this project is to display area and perimeter of 2D geometric shapes such as Rectangle, Triangle, Circle and Ellipse. The project follows a modular structure with separate header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files for each class.
 
## Folder Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:
 
- **include**: Contains header files for each geometric shape class.

- **src**: Contains implementation files corresponding to each header file.

- **main.cpp**: Main source file where the program execution starts.

##  1. Rectangle

- Header: include/Rectangle.h

- Implementation: src/Rectangle.cpp

## 2. Triangle

Header: include/Triangle.h

Implementation: src/Triangle.cpp

## 3. Circle

Header: include/Circle.h

Implementation: src/Circle.cpp
