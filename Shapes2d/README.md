# Plotting 2D Shapes in Gnuplot with C++

## Overview
This C++ project demonstrates how to generate data files for various 2D shapes using C++ code. Gnuplot, a versatile plotting utility, can then be used separately to plot these shapes using the generated data files.

## Getting Started
To use this project, ensure that Gnuplot is installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the [official Gnuplot website](http://www.gnuplot.info/).

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as `g++`, to compile and run the C++ code provided in this project.

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
3. Compile the C++ source files using a C++ compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ -o main main.cpp

## Supported Shapes
    This project includes C++ source files for generating data files for the following 2D shapes:
    
    ->Circle
    ->Rectangle
    ->Square
    ->Triangle
